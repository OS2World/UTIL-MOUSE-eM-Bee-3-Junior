Installing eM Bee 3: Junior!
----------------------------
    I initially thought I'd use the IBM installer, but the archive got
    *that* big.
    So here's a simple REXX script that does the following:
       + copies files to the appropriate locations
       + creates a folder with objects in it
       + places a shadow of the program in <WP_START>
